# How to Write a Research Problem Statement (Easy Guide + Free Templates)
<img src="src/assets/images/blog.webp" alt="Research Blog Cover" className="mdx-img"  />

A research problem statement is a short paragraph that explains **what is wrong**, **for whom**, and **why it matters**.  
You need it for a thesis, a grant, or a journal paper. Many students still search for “how to write a research problem” every day. Let’s make it simple.

We will use one clean example that works for both STEM and non-STEM fields:

> **Example thread:** Internet speeds vary significantly throughout a university campus. Does that hurt student engagement in blended (online + offline) classes?

## Highlights

- Turn a vague topic into a clear research problem statement (**Topic ≠ Problem**).
- Include the three essentials: **Gap**, **Context & Stakeholders**, and **Significance**.
- Measure what matters and conduct a quick feasibility check before making a commitment.
- Apply a short AI-Risk checklist (**Govern – Map – Measure – Manage**) and grab the free templates.

## 1. Topic ≠ Problem

A topic is significant and vague:  
> "Online learning in universities."

A problem is sharp:  
> "No one has measured how uneven internet speed on campus affects student engagement, so admins cannot plan upgrades."

**Key differences:**
- Names a gap (no measurement).
- Shows who and where (students on campus).
- Tells why it matters (budget and teaching quality).

This approach satisfies supervisors, reviewers, and funding bodies.  
It also helps search engines understand your page because you use clear, specific words like **"research problem statement"** and **"research gap"** in natural sentences.

## 2. The 3 Things Every Research Problem Statement Needs

1. **Gap or issue:** What is missing? What do we not know or do not do well yet?
2. **Context & stakeholders:** Who is affected? Where and when does it happen?
3. **Significance:** Why is this important to fix? Money, safety, fairness, policy — state it.

**Example:**
> "There is no data (gap) on how different broadband speeds across five Indian campuses affect student forum activity (context & stakeholders). Without this, IT budgets may be spent in the wrong places (significance)."

## 3. Steps 1 & 2: Show the Gap, Then Point to Who/Where/When

### Step 1 – Show the gap:
- Don’t guess.
- Check recent papers, policy notes, and reports.
- Write 1–2 lines that prove **this part is still unknown**.

### Step 2 – Define who/where/when:
- Avoid “everyone” and “everywhere”.
- Pick a group and a time window you can study.

**Example:**
> You will find many studies on "student satisfaction with e-learning," but none link internet speed logs to forum posts.  
> Stakeholders? Students in blended courses.  
> Place? Five campuses.  
> Time? Current academic year.

## 4. Steps 3 & 4: Make It Measurable + Check Feasibility

### Step 3 – Make it measurable:
- Replace fuzzy words (“impact”, “improve”) with measurable indicators (e.g., posts/week, watch-time, quiz scores).
- Avoid proxy traps (imperfect substitutes that cause bias).

### Step 4 – Feasibility check:
- Score from 1 to 5 on data access, time, ethics, skills, and budget.
- Adjust early if data is blocked or time is too short.

**Example:**
> Collect average download speed from campus routers and number of forum posts per student per week.  
> You have 4 months and approval to use anonymised logs.  
> **Score:** Data 4/5, Time 4/5, Ethics 3/5.

## 5. Steps 5 & 6: Write the Paragraph, Then Test It

**Template:**
> The problem addressed in this study is [gap], because [evidence of consequence], affecting [stakeholders/context]. This gap persists because [brief cause], and addressing it will [intended outcome].

**Filled Example:**
> “The problem addressed in this study is the lack of quantified evidence on how inconsistent campus broadband speeds influence forum participation in blended courses across five IIT campuses. This gap reduces the impact of ₹50 crore annual e-learning investments, affecting over 12,000 students across STEM and humanities. By linking speed logs with engagement data, the study will guide smarter bandwidth allocation.”

**Step 6 – Test and improve:**
- Show it to a mentor or ethics board.
- Ask: Is it specific? Measurable? Ethical?
- Fix weak parts now to save time later.

## Bonus: Quick AI-Risk Checklist

If you use data or AI, check:

- **Govern:** Who handles ethics and data rules?
- **Map:** Are measures fair for all groups?
- **Measure:** How will you test for bias or privacy leaks?
- **Manage:** What will you do if harm appears?

**Example:**
- Speed logs + engagement posts are fine.
- Number of complaints alone is weak.
- Hash IPs for privacy.
- If a campus is underserved, alert IT and suggest fixes.

### Plain Takeaway
State your problem as:
- **What is missing**
- **Who it hurts**
- **Why it matters**

Make it measurable, feasible, and ethical.
